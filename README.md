## Description

Stick-It lets you capture where stickers and street art are found, and explore posts from others on an interactive map.

Key features:
- Groups and community: Share posts with groups and discover new content from friends and others.
- Interactive map: View stickers and groups on the map and explore local rankings.
- Fast posting: Take a photo, tag it to a location, and share in seconds.
- Overview feed: Quickly enable/disable groups to curate your feed.

## How does it work?

The Stick-It app is built using the **Flutter** framework, which allows for cross-platform development on Android, iOS, and web platforms. Here's a high-level overview of how the app works:

### Project structure

The app is structured as follows:
 - **data**: contains data models, repositories, and services. Repositories handles and provides database operations. Services provide business logic for the app, including holding global state values and making api calls.
 - **features**: contains the app's features (mostly widgets where a route leads to), such as the main screen, group screen, and profile screen. Each directory is split into representation (UI) and data (screen specific logic and states).
 - **util**: contains utility classes, such as the app's theme, routing, and error handling.
 - **widgets**: contains reusable widgets that are used across the app. Each directory is split into representation (UI) and data (screen specific logic and states).

## Quick start (development)

1) Prerequisites
- Install Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
- Ensure a working Android/iOS development environment (Android Studio / Xcode on macOS for iOS).

2) Clone and install
```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/lr101/stick-it.git
cd stick-it

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get
```

3) Generate code (Freezed, Json Serializable, Riverpod)
```
# Generates all code and resolves any conflicts
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

4) Run the app
```
# Android
flutter run -d android

# iOS (requires macOS)
flutter run -d ios
```

### Optional: API generator setup
If you are working on the API client, clone the API repository next to this project and regenerate API code.
```
# Clone API repo next to this project
git clone git@github.com:lr101/MonaServerApi.git ../MonaServerApi

# Generate OpenAPI client
flutter pub global activate openapi_generator_cli
openapi-generator generate -i ../MonaServerApi/openapi.yaml -g dart -o ./api
```

## Developer references

### Set new icon
1. change asset path in pubspec.yaml
2. run: ```flutter packages pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main```

### Build Android APK
1. run: ```flutter build apk```

### Release app

The app release in Google Play Store and App Store is managed via Codemagic. The pipeline is triggered when a new commit is pushed to the main branch.

### Generate API (summary)
1. Activate openapi-generator: `flutter pub global activate openapi_generator_cli`  
2. Run generator: `openapi-generator generate -i ../MonaServerApi/openapi.yaml -g dart -o ./api`

## Troubleshooting

- iOS minimum version error (Firebase):
  - Error: The plugin "firebase_core" requires iOS 15.0+.  
  - Fix: In `ios/Podfile`, set `platform :ios, '15.0'` and ensure the `post_install` hook sets `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to `15.0` for all pods. Then run on macOS: `flutter clean && flutter pub get && cd ios && pod repo update && pod install`.

- Code generation errors (Freezed/Riverpod):
  - Run: `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
  - Ensure your files contain the correct `part 'file.freezed.dart';` and `part 'file.g.dart';` statements when required.

- Android build issues:
  - Run: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`.
  - Check your Java SDK and Android SDK versions in Android Studio.
